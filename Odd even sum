Problem Statement
You are given head which is a reference node to a singly- linked list. Complete the function oddeven which returns the absolute difference of sum of all elements at even nodes and odd nodes. The nodes are numbered from 1.
Input
User task:
Since this will be a functional problem, you don't have to take input. You just have to complete the function oddeven that takes the head of the linked list as parameter.

Constraints:
The Linked List is not empty.
Number of nodes will not exceed 1000.
Output
Return an integer - the absolute difference of sum of all elements at even nodes and odd nodes.
Example
Sample Input 1:-
3
1 2 3

Sample Output 1:-
2

Explanation
Odd sum = 1 + 3 = 4
Even sum = 2
Odd sum - even sum = 4 - 2 = 2


Sample Input 2:-
2
1 2

Sample Output 2:-
1

Explanation:
Odd sum = 1
Even sum = 2
Even sum - Odd sum = 2 - 1 = 1
